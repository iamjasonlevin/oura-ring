# oura-ring
For my Lambda School Data Science Unit 1 project, I conducted a Pythonic study of my sleep as tracked by my Oura Ring over 6 weeks.

You can view the analysis here: [jasonlevin.io/blog/oura-sleep-study](jasonlevin.io/blog/oura-sleep-study)

I am gathering a larger data set of Oura users.  Let me know if you want your sleep to be analyzed! 

And hit me on Twitter [@iamjasonlevin](twitter.com/iamjasonlevin).

Thank you.

Jason
